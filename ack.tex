\acknowledgment
\begin{text}

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my respected supervisor, Associate Professor Wu Biyu for her valuable instructions and unremitting guidance throughout my work. Her suggestions on my writing has greatly helped me. Without her painstaking encouragement, the article would never have been given a full shape.

In addition, I am so deeply thankful to all the teachers who have taught me in the School of Foreign Language for the past three years. Their excellent lectures have inspired me in one way or another.

Last but not least, I want to extent my heartfelt thanks to my family members for their immense love and constant support through the long process of my work.
